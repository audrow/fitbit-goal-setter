# Direction

## 2021-10-22

My next steps are to start implementing the Fitbit commands. This means the
following:

- Getting current data
- Getting active steps
- Creating a goal
- Comparing if a user has reached their goal

Later, I will make it easier to generate reports using this interface. Perhaps I
can also make a command for runnning arbitrary Fitbit API commands.

With this being said, I will start on getting the current data and then getting
the active steps today.
